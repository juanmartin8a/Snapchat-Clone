# Snapchat Clone
Snapchat clone written in Flutter :D

  - ## Why
    Great project for learning about mobile development

## Platforms
- iOS
- Android

## Tech used
- **Frontend framework**: Flutter
- **Main database**: Firebase Firestore
- **Authentication**: Firebase Auth
- **Cloud functions**: Firebase using Typescript
- **Notifications**: Firebase Cloud Messaging
- **Snap Map**: Google Maps

## Features
- ### Snaps
  A user can create snaps (videos or images) using the in-app camera and put them in their stories or save them in "memories".

- ### Friendships
  A user can add other users as friends and viceversa! The user who was added as friend can accept or not the friendship.
  
- ### Chat system
  The whole chat system has some nice features :D :
    - A user can start a chat with any other user.
    - A user can send snaps as messages.
    - A user can create a single chat with many users (group chat).
  
- ### Stories
    - A user can create snaps and put them in their stories.
    - A user can see stories from the people the user has added.
    - The stories section (when you can see the stories from your friends), also has a "for you" section where you can see recommended stories but for simplicity, and because this app was not meant for production, in it you can see all stories.
 
- ### Memories
  In memories, a user can see their saved snaps ordered by date. In there, a user search snaps by date and can select a snap to add it to their story or delete it.

- ### Snap Map
  In a virtual map, you can see where your friends are located!

- ### Search
  You can use the search feature to find users and add them as friends :).

- ### Profile
  Each user has a profile which includes information such as:
    - Name
    - Username
    - Email
 
## Example Videos :)
The app was tested using an android emulator in an old and saturated computer so the performance is terrible :). I sped up the videos 4x.
